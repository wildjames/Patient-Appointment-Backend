# PANDA

This is my solution to the code challenge from [here](https://github.com/airelogic/tech-test-portal/tree/main/Patient-Appointment-Backend).

The task mentions that this is time-sensitive, so needs to be done quickly. However, between now and the deadline I don't have a solid block of a few hours with which I can time myself in this way. So, unfortunately, this will have to be done in chunks of an hour, give or take, over a few days.

I will keep notes on my progress [here](./notes.md). 


Please also note that I have made a demo script, which allows users to interact with the API from the command line. First, ensure that the docker compose stack is running, then enter the demo by installing the requirements and executing it with python:
```
pip install -r demo_requirements.txt
python demo.py
```
Once it's loaded, just follow the instructions on screen.
